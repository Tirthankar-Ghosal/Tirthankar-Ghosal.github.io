I am currently a staff scientist in the [National Center for Computational Sciences](https://www.ornl.gov/division/nccs) at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov) in [Oak Ridge, TN](https://www.oakridgetn.gov). My specialization is Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general. I also teach a graduate-level course on NLP and Generative AI at the [University of Tennessee Knoxville](https://bredesencenter.utk.edu/faculty/tirthankar-ghosal/) as part of the [University of Tennessee-Oak Ridge Innovation Institute (UT-ORII)](https://utorii.com).

Background
======

I did my Ph.D. in 2020 from the [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in) on Computer Science and Engineering specializing in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning under [Prof. Asif Ekbal](https://ekbalasif.github.io) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/). Thereafter, I did my PostDoc (2020-2022) from the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Czech Republic](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tirthankar-ghosal) working on Speech and Language Processing in the Horizon 2020 EU projects [European Live Translator (ELITR)](https://elitr.eu) and [Neural Representations in Multi-modal and Multi-lingual Modelling (NEUREM3)](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/neurem3) with [Prof. Ondřej Bojar](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-bojar).

I joined [SciSpace](https://scispace.com) (2022-2023) in Bengaluru, India (headquatered in Palo Alto, California) as the Head of Research leading the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning team and working on building a semantic search engine and AI for academic research. I was also the principal science advisor of the Automotive Repair Intelligence company [Predii](https://www.predii.com) and NLP Consultant in the litigation support services company [Lexitas](https://www.lexitaslegal.com), both based in Palo Alto, California. Before joining my Ph.D. at IIT Patna, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering (2012-2106) at the [Sikkim Manipal Insititute of Technology](https://smu.edu.in/smit/), Sikkim, India. I did two Master's degree: one in Computer Applications (MCA) and the other in Computer Science and Engineering (M.Tech.). I am a **gold medalist (University First Rank Holder)** in both my Bachelor's and Master's degree from [University of North Bengal](https://nbu.ac.in), India.

I currently live in [Knoxville, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee) with my wife and daughter. I am originally from [Siliguri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siliguri), a city at the foothills of the Himalayas in West Bengal, India. I like travelling (road trips) and exploring new places, cooking spicy Indian food, reading Bengali literature, watching good movies, and above all playing with my little one.
