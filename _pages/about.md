I am currently a staff scientist in the [National Center for Computational Sciences](https://www.ornl.gov/division/nccs) (NCCS) at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov) (ORNL) in [Oak Ridge, TN](https://www.oakridgetn.gov) which is a US [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov) (DOE) laboratory. My specialization is Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general. I also teach a graduate-level course on NLP and Generative AI at the [University of Tennessee Knoxville](https://bredesencenter.utk.edu/faculty/tirthankar-ghosal/) as part of the [University of Tennessee-Oak Ridge Innovation Institute (UT-ORII)](https://utorii.com).

Background
======

I did my Ph.D. in 2020 from the [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in) on Computer Science and Engineering specializing in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning under [Prof. Asif Ekbal](https://ekbalasif.github.io) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/). Thereafter, I did my PostDoc (2020-2022) from the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Czech Republic](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tirthankar-ghosal) working on Speech and Language Processing in the Horizon 2020 EU projects [European Live Translator (ELITR)](https://elitr.eu) and [Neural Representations in Multi-modal and Multi-lingual Modelling (NEUREM3)](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/neurem3) with [Prof. Ondřej Bojar](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-bojar).

I joined [SciSpace](https://scispace.com) (2022-2023) in Bengaluru, India (headquatered in Palo Alto, California) as the Head of Research leading the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning team and working on building a semantic search engine and AI for academic research. I was also the principal science advisor of the Automotive Repair Intelligence company [Predii](https://www.predii.com) and NLP Consultant in the litigation support services company [Lexitas](https://www.lexitaslegal.com), both based in Palo Alto, California. Before joining my Ph.D. at IIT Patna, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering (2012-2016) at the [Sikkim Manipal Insititute of Technology](https://smu.edu.in/smit/), Sikkim, India. I did two Master's degree: one in Computer Applications (MCA) and the other in Computer Science and Engineering (M.Tech.). I am a **gold medalist (University First Rank Holder)** in both my Bachelor's and Master's degree from the [University of North Bengal](https://nbu.ac.in), India.

I currently live in [Knoxville, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee) with my wife and daughter. I am originally from [Siliguri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siliguri), a city at the foothills of the Himalayas in West Bengal, India. I like travelling (road trips) and exploring new places, cooking spicy Indian food, reading Bengali literature, watching good movies, and above all playing with my little one.

Research
======

I currently work on two broad areas: AI for Science (AI4S) and AI for Operations (AI4Ops). In AI4S, we work on Scientific Hypothesis Generation, training Large Language Models (LLMs) for science (Astrophysics, Material Science, Chemistry), Agentic AI Scientific Discovery in collaboration with several other organizations. Our goal is to support domain scientists in investigating big science problems with AI and Computing. In AI4Ops, my team at ORNL works on several operational problems relevant to ORNL and DOE that includes Hazardous Event Forecasting, High-Risk Property Identification, Proposal Review, Streamlining Activity-Based Work Control, Semantic Information Retrieval and Image Clustering for Neutron Science. The objective of the AI4Ops umbrella projects are to leverage the recent advances in AI to build/enhance internal ORNL/DOE operational capabilities.
